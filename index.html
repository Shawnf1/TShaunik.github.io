	<span class="block">Recognized the software being used by the Minneapolis Star and Tribune as having been written in an old language, had not been updated recently, was very time consuming and prone to errors and confusion among the end users.</span>
	<br>
	<span class="block"><li>Attention to Detail:</li> As a result of analyzing bills sent to stores, I noticed errors in bills that can result in losses of hundred each year due to data entry and formula problems.  The improved and simplified logic used to enter the data made it easier for the users to enter data and see any possible errors or omissions.  The weekly billing process for many locations was reduced from 5 hours to under 20 minutes. There are over 50 agencies that can benefit from using this software.</span>
	<span class="block"><li>Listen to Customer Input:</li> Interviewed several customers, determined the shortcomings of the current software and areas the customers felt could have additional features added.  This resulted in a script of features and functionality desperately required by the carriers and distribution sites.</span>
	<span class="block"><li>Analytical:</li> In reviewing the methods used to assign route boundaries, it was determined a much more efficient process could be used to chart the boundaries to make the process easier for end users, resulting in more efficient routes costing less time and money. The end result was to reduce the amount of time required to enter a typical route from 4 hours to under 8 minutes.</span>
	<span class="block"><li>Eager to Learn:</li> Recognized that the platform and language used to write the existing carrier programs was antiquated.  Became proficient with PHP and MySQL in order to write a new program in current languages, to benefit from the increases in efficiency due to modern programming languages and techniques.</span>
